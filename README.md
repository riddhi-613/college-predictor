# College Predictor System 
The objective was to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a student gaining admission into an IITs (Indian Institute of Technology) or NITs (National Institute of Technology) based solely on their JEE Mains score. This project aims to create an easy-to-use tool that provides an estimate of admission probability to an IIT or NIT, also predicting what different branches or degree programs that one might get.
