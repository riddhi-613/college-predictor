# College Predictor System 
The objective was to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a student gaining admission into an IITs (Indian Institute of Technology) or NITs (National Institute of Technology) based solely on their JEE Mains score. This project aims to create an easy-to-use tool that provides an estimate of admission probability to an IIT or NIT, also predicting what different branches or degree programs that one might get. 

# Need for college predictor system
1. Guidance for JEE Aspirants : With thousands of colleges and programs, students often feel overwhelmed when choosing the right college after their JEE exams.
 
2. Informed Decision-Making : A prediction system helps students make informed choices based on their ranks, category, location, and other criteria, improving the chances of securing admission in the best possible college.

3. Reducing Stress : By narrowing down options, this system eases the stress and anxiety of students and their families during the college selection process.

4. Efficiency and Accuracy : Leveraging machine learning, this system provides accurate and reliable predictions, saving time compared to manual research and guesswork.

5. Supporting Equity : The system takes into account categories, quotas, and seat availability, making the college admission process more accessible and equitable for all candidates.

# Steps taken for model creation
1. Data Collection and Loading :
Imported a dataset with college admission criteria for IITs and NITs.

2. Data Preprocessing :	
Cleaned data by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
Visualized features and patterns to guide feature selection.

4. Feature Selection and Engineering :
Chose relevant features and engineered additional ones for better predictions.

5. Model Selection and Training :
Trained and optimized models like Decision Tree and Random Forest.

6. Model Evaluation :
Assessed accuracy and other metrics for reliable predictions.
