# College Predictor System 
The objective was to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a student gaining admission into an IITs (Indian Institute of Technology) or NITs (National Institute of Technology) based solely on their JEE Mains score. This project aims to create an easy-to-use tool that provides an estimate of admission probability to an IIT or NIT, also predicting what different branches or degree programs that one might get. 

# Need for college predictor system
1. Guidance for JEE Aspirants : With thousands of colleges and programs, students often feel overwhelmed when choosing the right college after their JEE exams.
 
2. Informed Decision-Making : A prediction system helps students make informed choices based on their ranks, category, location, and other criteria, improving the chances of securing admission in the best possible college.

3. Reducing Stress : By narrowing down options, this system eases the stress and anxiety of students and their families during the college selection process.

4. Efficiency and Accuracy : Leveraging machine learning, this system provides accurate and reliable predictions, saving time compared to manual research and guesswork.

5. Supporting Equity : The system takes into account categories, quotas, and seat availability, making the college admission process more accessible and equitable for all candidates.

# Steps taken for model creation
1. Data Collection and Loading :
Imported a dataset with college admission criteria for IITs and NITs.

2. Data Preprocessing :	
Cleaned data by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
Visualized features and patterns to guide feature selection.

4. Feature Selection and Engineering :
Chose relevant features and engineered additional ones for better predictions.

5. Model Selection and Training :
Trained and optimized models like Decision Tree and Random Forest.

6. Model Evaluation :
Assessed accuracy and other metrics for reliable predictions.

# How to generate and run the project 
1. Generate the model and run the code for the same on vscode or any other suitable platform
2. Generation of requirements.txt file is the most important (here all the libraries used with thier versions used are stated).
3. Now the app.py app is the main which is the main app behind the flask code.
4. Run the app.py file andgo on to the localhost link to view the webpage.
5. The frontend webpage opens where the desired details about the candidates are submitted and then the desired college name, branch name and degree pursuing gets predicted on the screen.
