# College Predictor System 
The objective was to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a student gaining admission into an IITs (Indian Institute of Technology) or NITs (National Institute of Technology) based solely on their JEE Mains score. This project aims to create an easy-to-use tool that provides an estimate of admission probability to an IIT or NIT, also predicting what different branches or degree programs that one might get. 

# Steps taken for model creation
1.Data Collection and Loading :
Imported a dataset with college admission criteria for IITs and NITs.

2.Data Preprocessing :	
Cleaned data by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
Visualized features and patterns to guide feature selection.

4.Feature Selection and Engineering :
Chose relevant features and engineered additional ones for better predictions.

5.Model Selection and Training :
Trained and optimized models like Decision Tree and Random Forest.

6.Model Evaluation :
Assessed accuracy and other metrics for reliable predictions.
